# random-fortune-generator

## Project Overview
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

## Project Objectives:

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Project Plan
I'd like this to become a fortune generator. I think this can be accomplished by creating a few arrays: occupations, place to live, number of kids, level of wealth, etc. with a minimum of 10 entries in each array. The program will generate a random number that will represent an index number to select a string from each array.  The program will then compile the randomly selected items into a nice paragraph to output the users' fortune.
